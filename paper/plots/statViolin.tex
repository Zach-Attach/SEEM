  \caption{Plots of network statistics which were averaged in Table 1. Red lines denote the values of the \ce connectomes for comparison. L1 results (left) used 100 networks from each model. Adult results (right) used 100 networks sampled from all 3 adult \ce, resulting in 300 networks total for each model.}
