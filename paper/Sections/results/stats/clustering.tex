\subsubsection{Clustering Coefficient} Our initial model and RDDAM were the closest to \ce in this statistic, with our model performing better in adults and RDDAM performing better in the L1 connectome. Given these results, proximity alone might explain the clustering patterns of the \ce connectome.
