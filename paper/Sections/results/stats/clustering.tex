\subsubsection{Clustering Coefficient:} Our initial model and RDDAM were the closest to \ce in this statistic, with our model performing better in adults and RDDAM performing better in the L1 connectome. These results indicate that proximity alone might explain the clustering patterns of the \ce connectome. ...
Given that our random model (REEM) performed worse than our initial model, this implies that 

\textbf{RDDAM was closest to \ce in this statistic. This reinforces the idea that spatial proximity plays an important role in how neurons form connections and how they cluster in the way they do. It is surprising that our model did not have a stronger clustering coefficient given that closer neurites do not need to cross as large of a distance to potentially connect. This might account for why our model does slightly better than a random network. Although this difference is not that great.}
