\subsubsection{What does this tell us?} Looking at these statistics, it appears that RDDAM well characterizes the highly clustered neuronal networks of \ce. The edge distance of \ce appears to be only slightly shorter than random, which is likely explained by the spatial embedding of the network. The bidirectionality of \ce could not be explained by any network. 
It is notable that for all of these measures the results of our model are similar to random networks. This might be a result of how instance networks are created through random selection. It might also indicate that this network is not selective enough. As it stands, there is not a definitive explanation for these results.
