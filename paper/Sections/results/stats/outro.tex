\subsubsection{What does this tell us?} 
Looking at these statistics, it appears that the \ce connectome clusters are in line with what one might expect from such a spatially embedded graph. 
The number of long-distance connections suggests that the connectome of \ce does not prioritize close connections. 
It is more likely that short connections are just a result of neurites being more likely to come into contact with nearby neurons. 
Average connectivity points to a network that is more efficiently organized and far less redundant than any other networks examined. 
Our measures of bidirectional links show that \ce does appear to have a strong preference for bidirectional edges, in line with what RDDAM predicts. 
Our model (SEEM) appears to capture many of these network attributes reasonably well except for total connectivity and total number of bidirectional links.
