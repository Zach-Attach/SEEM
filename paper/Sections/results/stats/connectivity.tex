\subsubsection{Connectivity} Average connectivity was found to be much lower than any of the tested models would predict. 
In the L1 worm, our initial model appears to somewhat accurately predict this low connectivity. 
However, in the adult worms, this discrepancy becomes much larger. 
These results show that the network structure of \ce connectomes are much more sensative to perturbation than any of our other networks.
This indicates that the connections of neural networks of \ce are not as redundant as most networks. 
This is in line with previous work finding the connectome of \ce contains a ``rich club'' (i.e. a cluster of nodes all of which have a relatively high degree) and that its connectome is metabolically efficient (CITE).
