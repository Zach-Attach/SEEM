\subsubsection{Bidirectional Links}
The number of bidirectional links in \ce was shown to be most similar to the number found in RDDAM.
Given how accurate it is in predicting this metric, it is likely that spatial proximity explains the number of bidirectional edges in \ce.

It is interesting to note that these models have fewer bidirectional links in L1 and more bidirectional links in L5 when compared with \ce. 
Given that there are a greater number of connections in the L5 networks, more bidirectional links should be expected just from random chance alone, as we see in the results of our \er networks. 
Although, the results of \er networks show that random chance alone cannot explain the amount of growth in the number of connections between the two ages. 

Another simple explanation for this growth could be a result of the smaller number of connections possible under our model. 
One is more likely to flip two heads with a coin than one is to roll two 1's with a die, given the same number of flips/rolls. 
Our random model (REEM), on average found fewer potential connections compared with our initial model (SEEM). 
Given RDDAM's preference for short connections, an even smaller subset of possible connections are most likely to be made in the model, which is direction agnostic. 
This would explain why RDDAM has so many bidirectional links. 
These results indicate that the spatial proximity of soma alone can explain the network structure of \ce.
