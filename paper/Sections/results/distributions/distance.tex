\subsubsection{Distance Distributions} 
The edge distances of each model show an issue with RDDAM: its proclivity for short connections. 
We see that our model is most like \ce in this distribution, the same as what we found when comparing average edge distances. 
This indicates that the \ce frontal ganglia are not particularly distance dependent as indicated in \cite{Itzhack}. 
Given the similarity in the distributions, the spatial embedding of neurites could explain the edge distance distribution of \ce.
