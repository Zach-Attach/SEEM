\subsubsection{Distance Distributions:} The edge distances of each model show an issue with RDDAM: it favoring close connections. We see that our model is most like \ce in this distribution, the same as what we found when comparing average edge distributions. This indicates that \ce frontal ganglia is not particularly distance dependent as indicated in \cite{Itzhack}. Given the similarity in the distributions, spatial embedding alone could explain for the edge distance distribution of \ce.
