\section{Future Directions}

Recent mappings of C. elegans connectomes have shown how variable it is (2). We are currently comparing the connectomes from various adults and at various developmental stages to potentially learn new heuristics about mechanisms to include and test using these computational models, accounting for the underlying variability.
