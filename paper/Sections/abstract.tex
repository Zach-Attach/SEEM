  The human brain is poorly understood. 
  Although insufficient, understanding its structure is necessary to understanding how it operates.
  This structure on a microscale can vary wildly between individuals.
  Understanding how these networks form would help us in understanding this variability.
  With a relatively small and (near) completely reconstructed connectome, \ce is an ideal subject for this topic.
  % TODO: State a question!
  Computational modeling of these processes can begin to answer these questions, potentially leading to new insights that would otherwise be difficult to attain.
  % TODO: Attempted what? be more precise
  Previous research has attempted this by stochastically assigning connections, weighted by distance.
  We created a minimal model for understanding how neurites result in the particular of network atrributes found in \ce.
